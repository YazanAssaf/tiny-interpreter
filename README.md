# tiny-interpreter
An implementation of an interpreter following the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go". This project is a hands-on exercise in understanding interpreters

To-Do:
1- Create token data structure.

2- Build lexer, which consumes source code and produces a stream of tokens.

3- Build parser, which consumes a stream of tokens and builds an AST.

4 - Do optimization and execute AST.
